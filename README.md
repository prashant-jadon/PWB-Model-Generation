# PWB-Model-Generation


# Simple Basic Block Generation

In this Java code example, we demonstrate the fundamentals of creating a basic block for a blockchain data structure. This basic block consists of three essential attributes:

- `previousHash`: This attribute stores the hash value of the previous block in the blockchain, serving as a critical link between blocks in the chain.
- `transactions`: An array of strings representing the transactions or data contained within the current block.
- `blockHash`: This attribute stores the hash value of the current block. It is calculated based on both the hash of the previous block and the transactions within the current block.

### Constructor

The constructor of the `Block` class takes two parameters: `previousHash` and `transactions`. When you create a new block instance, it's essential to provide the hash of the previous block and a list of transactions that the new block will store.

### Block Hash Calculation

Inside the constructor, we create a new array called `contents`, which contains two elements:

1. The hash code of the `transactions` array, computed using `Arrays.hashCode(transactions)`. This hash code effectively summarizes the content of the current block.
2. The value of `previousHash`.

The `blockHash` attribute is then calculated by applying the `Arrays.hashCode` method to the `contents` array. This means that the block hash is derived from both the hash of the previous block and the content of the current block (i.e., the transactions).

### Getters

To allow access to the private attributes of the block, the `Block` class provides getter methods:

- `getPreviousHash()`: Retrieves the hash of the previous block.
- `getTransactions()`: Retrieves the array of transactions in the current block.
- `getBlockHash()`: Retrieves the hash value of the current block.

### Usage

You can create instances of the `Block` class by providing the hash of the previous block and a list of transactions. The block's hash is automatically computed and stored when an instance is created.

This code represents a fundamental building block for a blockchain data structure. In a real blockchain implementation, multiple blocks are linked together, and more complex hashing algorithms and validation mechanisms are used to ensure the security and integrity of the entire chain.
